# Rocket Flight Path Simulation

A project which renders a graph of a rocket's (parts defined using code) flight in the vertical axis vs time.

## Usage

Define a motor with its thrust curve. Define a stage and add the motor(s) to it. Both parallel and series staging is supported.  Define a rocket body which is a collection of stages.

You can run methods of the rocket body class to render the acceleration, velocity and the path in a single or multiple frames.

## Example

See main.py to learn how to use the modules.
